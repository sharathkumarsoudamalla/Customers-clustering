Hello,
here you receive one file, that contains purchasing data of a shop.
Whether it's online or offline is not important right now.
Lets assume it's a garage for automotive vehicles.
Data has been sufficiently anonymized that no conclusions to existing entities
are possible.

The content is the following:
  1. row i: Each row represents a customer
     (e.g. 7700383178='John Doe')
  2. column j: each column defines a product category
     (e.g. 3.0='repair services')
  3. values(i, j): the amount of money that customer i spend on products of
     category j

     A. We'd like to identify whether there are any meaningful clusters in the data
     (might be none)
     Which steps are necessary/ useful?
